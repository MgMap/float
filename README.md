# PCC-MATE-ROV-FLOAT
Repo for development of vertical profiling float codebase.

Push all untested code the `develop` branch. Only merge code into the main branch once it has been thoroughly tested by the team! `develop` will likely end up being 50 commits ahead of main and that's totally normal. When our future teammates pull from the `main` branch, we want them to pull rock solid, reliable code.    


The competition will be held from June 20-22 in Kingsport, Tennessee. Here's the [briefing document](https://20693798.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/20693798/2024_MATE_ROV_Competition_Briefing_Final.pdf) with the competition requirements. Please checkout the [previous years float designs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/121Tz7x0-EfkKMqCjBjuEYqYDveyaxTBM) for inspiration, lots of great design ideas there!
